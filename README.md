# Zed8E - A Z-80 based implementation of FORTH

This is the Zed8E project. One day it may be a small, simple SBC
with FORTH in ROM. For now it is a pure software project.

## TODO

* Write documentation. Lots of documentation.
* Write code. Lots of code.
* Find a suitable Z-80 emulation environment to run tests.
* Run tests. Lots and lots and lots of tests!
* Design the hardware. Likely in KiCAD.
* Build and test sample boards.
* Bask in glory and acclaim!
